# Automated-Inventory-Management (AIM)
## Introduction
 Automated inventory management has revolutionized the way businesses keep track of their stock and manage their supply chain. With the help of advanced technology and sophisticated software, inventory management systems have become more efficient, accurate, and streamlined than ever before. This technology allows businesses to automate the entire inventory management process, from tracking inventory levels to placing orders and managing shipments. By adopting an automated inventory management system, businesses can reduce errors, optimize inventory levels, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase their bottom line.
### Overview
 Automated inventory management is a system that leverages technology to streamline the process of tracking and managing inventory levels. It involves the use of various technologies such as software applications to automate inventory tracking, reordering, and supply chain management. The goal of automated inventory management is to increase efficiency, accuracy, and speed while reducing costs and errors associated with manual inventory management. Some 
benefits of automated inventory management include better inventory accuracy, 
reduced stockouts and overstocking, improved productivity, and faster order fulfillment. However, implementing automated inventory management also comes with its own set of challenges, including the initial investment in technology, staff training, and system integration with existing processes. Overall, automated inventory management can significantly improve business operations and help companies remain competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.

### Project Aim and Objectives
 The aim of automated inventory management using computer vision is to leverage visual sensing and analysis technologies to enhance and streamline the process of inventory management. The primary objective of implementing such a system is to improve efficiency, accuracy, and productivity in inventoryrelated tasks.

 ### Architecture and Design
  The architecture and design for on-shelf availability and product counting systems are focused on ensuring accurate and real-time information about the availability of products on store shelves. These systems utilize technology to monitor inventory levels, track product movements, and store the availability of the products on a database so the owner can refer to to check for the availability of the products. In addition, the system can send alerts to the owner in case of low stock or out of stock.

  ### Data collection
 The data collection for this project is not easy,because it needs a lot of pictures so the model can learn properly. In this project we took about (1300) pictures for specific products; some pictures contain all of the products shuffled, some pictures contain some of the products. Moreover, we took pictures for every product from all sides.
