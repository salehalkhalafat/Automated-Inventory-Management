# Automated-Inventory-Management (AIM)
### Overview
 Automated inventory management is a system that leverages technology to streamline the process of tracking and managing inventory levels. It involves the use of various technologies such as software applications to automate inventory tracking, reordering, and supply chain management. The goal of automated inventory management is to increase efficiency, accuracy, and speed while reducing costs and errors associated with manual inventory management. Some benefits of automated inventory management include better inventory accuracy, reduced stockouts and overstocking, improved productivity, and faster order fulfillment. However, implementing automated inventory management also comes with its own set of challenges, including the initial investment in technology, staff training, and system integration with existing processes. Overall, automated inventory management can significantly improve business operations and help companies remain competitive in today's fast-paced business environment.

 ### Data collection
 The data collection for this project is not easy,because it needs a lot of pictures so the model can learn properly. This project contains (1300) pictures for specific products; some pictures contain all of the products shuffled, some pictures contain some of the products, and of course the pictures were taken from both sides for each product.
